# Delegated Proof of Work - API
Worker API for P2P delegated Proof of Work, Nano cryptocurrency

## Introduction

This project has the ability to make Nano instantaneous for any type of low computing device by delegating PoW to Workers on a P2P network, requiring no central servers / coordinators.

The only way a user can have their transaction completed by Worker is to attach an extra transaction block as a reward after their transactions. The only way for a Worker to receive his reward is by completing PoW and broadcasting the user's transaction first to be able to validate his reward block.

## Configuring
First you will need to have a <strong>Nano node >= v.19.0</strong> installed and synchronized.
- Edit the worker_config.json file. Enter:
	- Your Nano Account where the rewards will be deposited. It must have a small amount of Nano as it will be used to register your network node within a transaction.
	- The Private Key of this account (attention, do not confuse with the master seed). Required to sign the decentralized registration transaction. Don't worry, the registration transaction signature is made directly from your computer and no one else will have access to your private keys.
	- Your preferred Representative
	- The Minimum Fee you prefer for each job, represented in mNano. Current suggestion: 0.001
	- Your Node address with RPC port. Probably 127.0.0.1:7076
	- Your Worker Node Address (can be the same as node).
	- Active Difficulty can be ignored for now, I recommend you leaving false
	- Max Mltiplier will be the maximum PoW difficulty your worker will accept when using active difficulty in dynamic PoW
	- API running Port. 7090 by default.
	Example:

    {
    	"reward_account": "nano_3k8it4efod5hw194axu1m483qee7pryfrfung9pyr8x9pysfpz1bothqmo1y",
		"private_key": "79E937E6A24B2ABC7DD3894F03BF62303BE8CBA936CBEC7CA3BACEC763AF3BB2",
		"representative": "nano_3x7cjioqahgs5ppheys6prpqtb4rdknked83chf97bot1unrbdkaux37t31b",
 		"fee": 0.0001,
		"node": "127.0.0.1:7076",
		"worker": "127.0.0.1:7076",
		"use_active_difficulty": false,
		"max_multiplier": 10.0,
		"port": 7090
    }



## How to run

Install python dependencies
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
run:
    python3 api.py


## How it works

The user requests Workers confirmation at the endpoint worker_ip_address:7090/open_request
And get the following kind of answer:

      {				 
      		"fee": 100000000000000000000000000,
      		"max_multiplier":10.0,
      		"min_multiplier":1.0,
      		"reward_account":"nano_3k8it4efod5hw194axu1m483qee7pryfrfung9pyr8x9pysfpz1bothqmo1y",
      		"version":"0.0.1"
      }


This is the worker's reward address and his minimum fee per work (in raws).
This fee must be multiplied by the (number of transactions sent - transaction reward)

Then users will use this information to sign the worker reward transaction.


Users can request the PoW by calling the endpoint (/request_pow) sending a json data like the following one:


        curl -s --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{

The first transaction is the user_transaction. The second one (worker_transaction) is responsible for the payment of the worker.


If all goes well, the output by the worker API will look like this:

## Decentralized Registration
Instead of a Nano-like peering system or protocols like torrent, this project introduced a new way for peers to exchange their IP addresses.
This API automatically saves the worker IP (ipv4 or ipv6) in a Nano transaction, after encoding to nano account format, and associates it with the default register account (1de1egated1proof1ofwork1themain1registration1accountp46rpyr6) with other transaction.
That's why you need to put your account private key in worker_config.json and have a small balance there.


Customers of users interested in hiring workers read the transaction history of the registration account. There they find the workers account. And in the workers account they will find their IP addresses, through which P2P user<->worker connections are made. The interesting thing about this system is that besides saving bandwidth and avoiding certain attacks, it avoids the need for main peers and also allows us to associate and recognize worker accounts.


## GPU
Although you can use your CPU for testing, if you want to be a worker it is recommended to use a good GPU, as in worker competition the best hardware solves PoW first.
For this you need to have your GPU drivers properly installed and OpenCL. With this your node will use its GPU for PoWs.


The next version will also allow the user to request PoW for multiple transactions at once. Reward block only needs to be 1, last in chain.

## Attention!!!
This version is not much more than a Proof of Concept yet. Use for small transactions only.
